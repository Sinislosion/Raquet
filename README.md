### Linux
1. First install the necessary dependencies<br>

	`sudo pacman -S clang sdl2 sdl2_mixer`

### Windows
You'll need to use either Windows, Debain Linux, or WSL (Untested, but should work)
1. If you're on Linux, start with compiling [wclang](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/wclang/tree/master), and edit the `windowscompile.sh` file to use wclang instead of MSYS2
3. On Windows, download [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
